       <h1>History of <strong>Android </strong>logo</h1>
      <p> 
        
        <p><strong>Android </strong>application development started a long time ago in 1989, contrary to your belief that it just started recently.</p>

<p>Plus, to make things interesting, the name isn't a tech name either, as it was simply derived from the nicknames of one of the founders, Andy Rubin.</p>
<p>
    
    When Andy Rubin was still working at Apple, he loved <strong>Android </strong>robots more than anything. With so much love for robots, his colleagues started calling him Android, which later became official and was also an operating system.
</p>

<p>As history has it, Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, Nick Sears, and Chris White founded <strong>Android </strong>Inc.</p>

<p>Andy Rubin has developed <strong>Android </strong>so that it can be used in smart cell phones that know their owner's preferences and even location.</p>
        
        
        <p>
            Many people around the world are familiar with the green robot. However, few can describe the history of the logo.
            
            <p>Irina Block, a Google graphic designer, is known for developing the logo in 2007, stating that the logo should be international and closely related to the name. This prompted the team to draw some simple designs and sketches.</p>
            
            <p>The current logo is also said to have undergone several modifications in the past. The green color is used simply because green contrasts with almost all colors, but especially with dark ones.</p>
        </p>
    
    
    <p>
        At some point, it was even claimed that the logo was plagiarized from the game Gauntlet: The Third Encounter. Block refuted such claims and said that the logo was her original work.

    <h2>History of <strong>Android</strong> Studio</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Android</strong> is simply known as the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Google’s <strong>Android</strong> operating system.</p>
    
    <p>
        It was built by JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA and was mainly designed for <strong>Android</strong> development. You can also choose to download it through Windows, Mac OS, and even Linux-based operating systems that you may be using.
        
    </p>
    <p>It’s also important to have in mind that this is simply a newer version of the Eclipse <strong>Android</strong> Development Tools which was the initial IDE for <strong>Android</strong> application development.</p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Android</strong> Studio was first released at a Google I/O conference in 2013, on March 16. Later, in May 2013, it was in the preview phase, or version 0.1. From here, it went into the beta phase in 2014 of version 0.8.
        
    </p>
    <p>
        The first stable version of <strong>Android</strong> Studio was created in December 2014. It is also known as version 1.0.
        
    </p>
    <p>Another factor worth knowing is that on May 7, 2019, Java, the most endorsed programming language for <strong>Android</strong> app development, was replaced by Kotlin. Java is still available and supported in C++.</p>
    
    <strong>Summary</strong> <br>
    <p>In summary, we see that every new <strong>Android</strong> version brings exciting new changes. <p><strong>Android</strong> 13 will not be the last version of the popular operating system. In the future, Android will continue to evolve. Stay tuned for more groundbreaking changes</p>.</p>
